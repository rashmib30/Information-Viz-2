      <div class="intro-anime">
        Anime is a style of animation originating from Japan, characterized by
        colorful artwork, vibrant characters, and fantastical themes. It covers
        a wide range of genres and appeals to various age groups, with stories
        that often include elements of adventure, romance, science fiction, and
        fantasy. Anime can be broadcast on television, streamed online, or
        distributed as films and OVAs (original video animations). Notable
        examples include Naruto, My Hero Academia, and Spirited Away.

      <div class="intro">Why did global audience find anime appealing?</div>
      <div class="intro-anime">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anime features expressive character designs with large eyes and
            vibrant backgrounds which makes it appealing .
          </li>
          <li>
            Anime often explores complex themes and diverse genres, including
            deep emotional and philosophical topics, and caters to various age
            groups. It addresses various issues & uses global narrative making
            it relatable for everyone. Genres like sci-fi, robots, battle were
            never explored by western animation before anime did.
          </li>
          <li>
            Anime spans various demographics, including shonen, shojo, seinen,
            and josei, breaking the stereotype that animation is only for kids.
            This makes their audience base larger.

        The overseas anime market has been growing gradually since 2002. The
        domestic market (plotted in black) also shows a gradual growth
        throughout the years. The dip in international revenue comes in picture
        when the Great Recession hit the global economies.<br />One of the most
        curious new facts to emerge is that Japanese anime might just be the
        world’s most COVID-resistant form of popular entertainment. <br /><br />
        According to consultancy Parrot Analytics, global demand for anime
        content grew 118 percent over the past two years, making it one of the
        fastest-growing content genres throughout the pandemic .
        <br /><br />Those who are tapped into Japan’s anime industry say the
        precursors for these boom times have been building for years. During the
        decade before the pandemic, from 2009 to 2019, Japan’s anime industry
        doubled in total market value to $22.1 billion, according to the
        Association of Japanese Animations.

            An anime fan is known as <b>Otaku</b> which in Japanese means people
            with obsessive interests, including anime or manga. It was termed as
            offensive in late 1980s. But later, the fans themselves started
            using it in a positive light and today it is often used by those
            outside of the fandom to refer to fans of anime or manga
          </li>
          <li><b>More than 50% of fans</b> are millenials.<br /></li>
