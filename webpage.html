        Anime is a style of animation originating from Japan, characterized by
        colorful artwork, vibrant characters, and fantastical themes. It covers
        a wide range of genres and appeals to various age groups, with stories
        that often include elements of adventure, romance, science fiction, and
        fantasy. Anime can be broadcast on television, streamed online, or
        distributed as films and OVAs (original video animations). Notable
        examples include Naruto, My Hero Academia, and Spirited Away.
